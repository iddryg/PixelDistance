Using multi-channel microscopy images, calculates the minimum distance between two markers. In this case, it was used to calculate how invasive tumor cells were in lymph nodes by measuring the minimum distance between tumor-positive pixels and pixels positive for a lymphatic vessel marker (LYVE-1).
